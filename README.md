## Conferencify System Architecture Flow**

1. **User Interface (Frontend)**
   - **Client Interaction:** Users access the web app via a browser.
   - **Framework:** Built using Next.js with TypeScript for a responsive and dynamic UI.
   - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ensures a consistent and modern design.
   - **Component Structure:** Reusable components for UI, housed in the `components` directory.

2. **Authentication Layer**
   - **Clerk Integration:** Manages user sign-up, login, and session handling.
   - **Middleware:** Next.js middleware ensures authentication checks before route access.

3. **Real-Time Communication (Core Functionality)**
   - **GetStream API:** Handles video call room creation and participant management.

4. **Backend (API & Data Flow)**
   - **Next.js API Routes:** Manages call initiation, user presence, and notifications.
   - **Database (Optional):** Can integrate Firebase or MongoDB for user and session persistence.

5. **State Management**
   - **Redux Toolkit:** Manages global state for user sessions and call status.

6. **Deployment & Hosting**
   - **Vercel:** Continuous deployment of the Next.js app.

7. **Monitoring & Error Handling**
   - **Sentry:** Tracks application errors and performance issues.

**Flow Summary:**
- User logs in → Joins/creates a room → GetStream manages room & participants → User ends call → Session ends.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
